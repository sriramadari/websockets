# WebSocket Introduction and Simple Server Example

This repository provides a basic introduction to WebSockets and demonstrates how to set up a simple WebSocket server using the `ws` library in combination with an Express server. The example includes both the server-side code and a basic frontend HTML file for interacting with the WebSocket server.

## WebSocket Introduction

WebSockets are a communication protocol that enables real-time, bidirectional, full-duplex communication between a client and a server over a single, persistent connection. This is in contrast to the traditional request-response model of HTTP, allowing for instantaneous data exchange and live updates.

For a comprehensive introduction to WebSockets, including their benefits and key features, you can refer to the [WebSocket Introduction](websocket-introduction.md).

## Server Setup

The server is implemented using the `express` framework and the `ws` library for WebSocket functionality. The `server.js` file contains the server-side code that handles WebSocket connections, messages, and disconnections.

For detailed instructions on setting up the server and understanding the server-side code, refer to the [Server Setup](server-setup.md) guide.

## Frontend Setup

The frontend is a simple HTML file named `index.html` that provides an interface to send and receive messages to and from the WebSocket server. This basic interface demonstrates how the client can interact with the WebSocket connection.

To understand how to set up the frontend and how the communication is established, see the [Frontend Setup](frontend-setup.md) guide.

## Running the Example
