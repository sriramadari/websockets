# WebSocket Introduction and Simple Server Example

This repository provides a basic introduction to WebSockets and demonstrates how to set up a simple WebSocket server using the `ws` library in combination with an Express server. The example includes both the server-side code and a basic frontend HTML file for interacting with the WebSocket server.

## WebSocket Introduction

WebSockets are a communication protocol that enables real-time, bidirectional, full-duplex communication between a client and a server over a single, persistent connection. This is in contrast to the traditional request-response model of HTTP, allowing for instantaneous data exchange and live updates.

## Server Setup

The server is implemented using the `express` framework and the `ws` library for WebSocket functionality. The `socket.js` file contains the server-side code that handles WebSocket connections, messages, and disconnections.

## Frontend Setup

The frontend is a simple HTML file named `client.html` that provides an interface to send and receive messages to and from the WebSocket server. This basic interface demonstrates how the client can interact with the WebSocket connection.

## Running the Example

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install the required dependencies:
4. Start the server:
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000/client.html` to access the frontend interface.
6. Enter messages and observe the real-time communication between the client and the server.
